deloitte interview questions:
-----------------------------
1: Hadoop architecture along with all components.
2: Hive architecture.
3: What is Hive catelog or HCatelog?
4: What are all Hive Services?
5: What is YARN? What it does actually?
6: Who will recieve notification or signals when name node getting down?
>> ZooKeeper Failover Controler
7: What is secondary namenode or standby namenode? And how it will work?
>>Secondary namenode is just a helper for Namenode.
  It gets the edit logs from the namenode in regular intervals and applies to fsimage.
  Once it has new fsimage, it copies back to namenode.
  Namenode will use this fsimage for the next restart, which will reduce the startup time.
  Secondary Namenode's whole purpose is to have a checkpoint in HDFS. Its just a helper node for namenode. Thatâ€™s why it also known as checkpoint node.
  But, It cant replace namenode on namenode's failure.
  So, Namenode still is Single-Point-of-Failure.
  To overcome this issue; STANDBY-NAMENODE comes into picture.
  It does three things:
  merging fsimage and edits-log files. (Secondary-namenode's work)
  receive online updates of the file system meta-data, apply them to its memory state and persist them on disks just like the name-node does.
  Cluster will switch over to the new name-node (this standby-node) if the active namenode dies.
  
8: What is the difference between where and having?
9: What is the actual mechanism of where,having,group by, order by clauses?
10: What is oozie? What's the role of it in Hadoop ecosystem?
>>Oozie is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.
  Oozie Workflow jobs are Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs) of actions.
